## Apache James
The following describes the setup and isntallation of the apache james mail server + 

### Installation
Unzip the archive in the installation directory. + 
*Additionally* I had to add the jaxb-2.1-impl.jar since the jdk seems not to have it in its classpath. Otherwise server won't start. +

#### Start/Stop
1. Add *apache-james-{version}\bin to PATH so that james, james-cli is available from anywhere
2. Modify the wrapper.conf as intended (added jaxb-2.1-impl.jar)
3. Register service via *james install*
4. Start server via *james start*
5. Stop server via *james stop*
6. Remove registered service via *james remove*
